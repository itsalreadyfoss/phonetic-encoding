Metaphone3 was released under BSD here:
https://code.google.com/p/google-refine/source/browse/trunk/main/src/com/google/refine/clustering/binning/Metaphone3.java?r=2617

No patent covers Metaphone 3 that I've found so far. Notify me if you find
one. I'm not an expert but I don't think it is patentable.
